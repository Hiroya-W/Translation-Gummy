Contributing to Translation-Gummy
============================

There are many ways to contribute to `Translation-Gummy`, with the most common ones being contribution of code or documentation to the project. I haven't made the documentation yet, so I would really appreciate it if you could. I'm planning to make a document under the doc/ directory using [`pelican`](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/) or [`Mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

But there are many other ways to help. In particular answering queries on the issue tracker, investigating bugs, and reviewing other developers' pull requests are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs up üëç" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles, link to it from your website, or simply star it in GitHub to say "I use it".
